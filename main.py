"""
Minimal VRP with CP-SAT (OR-Tools) â€” 2 vehicles, 5 customers, 1 depot, with Soft Time Windows, Workers & Skills
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements implemented:
 - Vehicle departs/returns from depot
 - Flow conservation per vehicle
 - Each customer visited exactly once
 - MTZ subtour elimination
 - Soft time windows and service times
 - Multiple workers assignment and boarding
 - Skill requirements at each customer
